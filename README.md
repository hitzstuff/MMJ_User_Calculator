# MMJ_User_Calculator
Helps medical marijuana patients calculate their allotments beyond the state's method of  'x' every 'y' days.

How to use:
----------
1. Download the 'MMJ User Calculator' folder to the desired location on your PC.
2. Click on the icon labeled 'mmj_user_calculator - Shortcut'

That's it! Nothing to it.

*NOTE:
The program loads/saves the data from/into the mmj_allotments.txt file, located in the dist folder. Do NOT edit or delete mmj_allotments.txt, or the program will no longer function.

What it does:
------------
Takes the patient's Florida medical marijuana allotments, and breaks them down into the following:
- Weekly allotment
- Daily allotment
- Hourly allotment (16 hour day, assuming 8 hours for sleep)

In addition, it also breaks the flower allotments down into grams / ounces, so that the user can more easily compare and manage their allotment.
