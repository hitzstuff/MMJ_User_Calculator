Windows shortcut links break if you try to use them across different PCs.

To solve this issue, I made a batch file that will create the shortcut for you.

Simply double click on the 'create_shortcut.bat' file located in the 'MMJ User Calculator' folder.
That's it! The file takes care of the rest, and you should see a shortcut appear within the 'MMJ User Calculator' folder.
This shortcut can then be moved to wherever you would like!

Any issues should be reported on the program's GitHub page: https://github.com/hitzshit/MMJ_User_Calculator
